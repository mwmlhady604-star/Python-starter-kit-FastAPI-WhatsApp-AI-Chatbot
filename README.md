# FastAPI WhatsApp AI Chatbot Starter Kit 🚀

A production-ready starter kit to build efficient WhatsApp Chatbots powered by AI (OpenAI), built with **FastAPI**, **SQLModel**, and **Asyncio**.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Seamless integration with OpenAI GPT models.
- **WhatsApp Cloud API**: Native integration for receiving and sending messages.
- **SQLModel + AsyncSQLite**: Easy-to-use Async ORM with SQLite (extensible to PostgreSQL).
- **Structured Architecture**: Service-based architecture for scalability.
- **Best Practices**: Type-safe, linted with `ruff`, managed with `uv`.
